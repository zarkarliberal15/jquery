            jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, 
            as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.
             As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites. 
             Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, 
             having 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.
